# Hand-Written-Digit-Classifier

This project is a simple web application that recognizes handwritten digits. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch and a user interface created with Streamlit.

Users can either upload an image of a digit or use their device's camera to take a picture, and the model will predict the digit.

Model Performance

When trained for 50 epochs using the train.py script, the model achieves:

Test Accuracy: 99.14%
Average Test Loss: 0.0586

Project Structure

train.py: The Python script to train the CNN model (defined as CNNModel). It downloads the MNIST dataset, trains the model, and saves the weights as mnist_cnn_model.pth.

app.py: The main Streamlit application script. It loads the pre-trained mnist_cnn_model.pth and provides the web interface for inference. It is critical that the CNNModel class in this file matches the one in train.py.

requirements.txt: A list of all necessary Python packages to run the project.

mnist_cnn_model.pth: The saved model weights (generated by running train.py). Note: You will need to run train.py to create this file.

How to Run

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://your-repo-url/mnist-digit-recognizer.git
cd mnist-digit-recognizer


Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Train the Model:
Run the training script to generate the mnist_cnn_model.pth file.

python train.py


This will download the MNIST dataset and may take a few minutes to train.

Run the Streamlit App:
Once the model is trained and saved, you can run the app.

streamlit run app.py


A new tab will open in your browser at http://localhost:8501 with the running application.
